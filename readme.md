# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is the functional, responsive rendition of the game we used to love as kids.

## Features

It supports the combination of as many colors as you want in the same sketch. This takes place through the buttons, which correspond to either pre-selected colors, or dynamically-generated ones. Precisely, there are:

- Fixed color buttons for _black_ and _blue_.
- Dynamic color buttons for _random_ and _custom_ colors.
- Eraser, to fix any unwanted coloring.

## Tech

This project was implemented with:

- JavaScript
- SCSS
- HTML
